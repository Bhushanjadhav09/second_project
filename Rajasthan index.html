       <p>Welcoming the spring season, the Mewar festival is celebrated throughout the state with vigour. Udaipur is the epicentre of this festival as the Mewar rulers governed this state from Udaipur, which is why you can get the best of experience of the festival from this city.
          The whole of Udaipur is wonderfully decorated to witness this fiesta. The main significance is given to the women who are decked up in their best attire to mark the celebrations.
          The key highlight is dressing up of Isar, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. Gangaur (Parvati) is dressed up as well and their idols are carried through the streets towards the Gangaur ghat at Lake Pichola.
          The idols are then placed in the boats and immersed into the lake. This festival is marked with songs, traditional dance and fireworks, which is a sight to behold. This festival takes place during the months of March or April.

         <p>Rajasthani cuisine is the traditional cuisine of the Rajasthan state in north-west India. It was influenced by various factors like the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants, the availability of ingredients in an arid region and by Hindu temple traditions of sampradayas like Pushtimarg and Ramanandi.Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred.
            Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. Signature Rajasthani dishes include Dal Baati Churma, Panchratna Dal, Papad ro Saag, Ker Sangri,Gatte ro Saag. It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, Mirchi bada and Kanda kachauri. Other famous dishes include Dal Baati, malaidar special lassi (lassi) and Lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), Mawa lassi from Jodhpur, Alwar ka mawa, Malpauas from Pushkar and rasgulla from Bikaner, "paniya"and "gheriya" from Mewar.
            Originating for the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Brahmins, Jains, Bishnois and others preferred a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies.</p>
