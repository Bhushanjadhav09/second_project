    <h1><center>Information Of Maharashtra</center></h1>

Maharashtra has software parks in many cities around the state, and is the second largest exporter of software with annual exports over ₹ 80,000 crores.

    <h3>language</h3>
    <p>Marathi language, Indo-Aryan language of western and central India. Its range extends from north of Mumbai down the western coast past Goa and eastward across the Deccan; in 1966 it became the official language of the state of Maharashtra. The standard form of speech is that of the city of Pune (Poona).

        Descended from the Mahārāṣṭrī Prākrit, Marathi has a significant literature. Books are printed in Devanāgarī script, which is also used for handwriting, although a closely related script, Modi, was also often used for handwriting until the mid-20th century. Eastern Hindi is the Indo-Aryan language most closely related to Marathi. Like Hindi, Marathi has lost most of its inflectional system to indicate case, using instead postpositions (like prepositions, only following the word) with an oblique “case” to serve the function originally filled by inflection.</p>
      <h3>Culture of Maharashtra?</h3>
      <p>The culture of Maharashtra is a rich blend of traditional customs, art forms, festivals, and cuisine. It is characterized by its diverse traditions, including classical music, dance forms like Lavani and Tamasha, vibrant arts like Warli painting, and significant festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi & Diwali.
        Maharashtrian culture is important because it reflects the state's diverse history and heritage. It offers a unique blend of traditions and modernity, showcasing India's cultural diversity. The state's festivals, arts, and cuisine contribute significantly to India's rich cultural tapestry.</p>
